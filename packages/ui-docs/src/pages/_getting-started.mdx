# Getting Started

First we need to install `@blockstack/ui` and its various dependencies.

```bash
yarn add @blockstack/ui styled-components babel-plugin-styled-components
```

> Please note that you will need to have the [styled-components babel plugin](https://github.com/styled-components/babel-plugin-styled-components) set up in your project in order to use the `css` prop.

Now we need to import our `ThemeProvider` into the app that we're using Blockstack UI with. The ThemeProvider creates a context scope for all of our components to use.

```jsx live=false
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@blockstack/ui';

// Use at the root of your app
<ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>;
```

## Using components

Simply import components by name from the `@blockstack/ui` package, as shown
below.

```js
import { Button } from '@blockstack/ui';
```

## Injecting global styles

Sometimes you may need to apply css reset styles to your page. Blockstack UI exports
a `CSSReset` that'll remove browser default styles. It's heavily inspired by
[Tailwind's preflight](https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@1.1.2/dist/base.css).

```jsx live=false
const App({ children }) => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <CSSReset />
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```
